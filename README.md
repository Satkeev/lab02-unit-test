lab02-unit-test  
Author: Kamit Satkeev  
Description  
This is a C# console app that simulates an ATM machine and lets the user interactively perform standard ATM  
operations such as view balance and withdraw funds. The user will also be able to do other mock ATM operations  
like add/deposit money. It anticipates and handles a variety of exceptions and was built using TDD principles.
